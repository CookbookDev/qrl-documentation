## Send QRL

With the wallet unlocked, you can now send QRL.


To send QRL there are four fields you need to fill in:

| Field |  Description  |
|:-----|:--| 
| **Recipient Address** | A valid QRL address |
| **Amount** | How much QRL to send |
| **Fee** | How much you are paying to make this transaction |
| **OTS Key Index** | Enter an unused OTS Key |

> Keep track of used OTS Keys! The web wallet will keep track of your OTS key index for you from the blockchain, but it is good practice to write this number down after each use.
{: .info}


Make sure everything is correct and click the confirm button. The transaction will be propagated across the QRL network and deposited into the address you entered. Your screen will show the confirmation details as the transaction is sent. 
 
## Receive QRL

Simply give someone your QRL address and they can send you coins. You don't need to have the wallet opened in order to receive QRL.

Click the receive tab in the wallet and you will see your wallet address and QR code. Send this to whomever you are receiving coins from.
