### During Address Creation

<span>
    <p>
        During the creation of a new address the {props.name} wallet software will prompt for the user to save the private details of their new address. 
    This information must be recorded to open the wallet address in the future. After entering a passphrase for the encrypted wallet file the system will prompt for the user to save the mnemonic or secret key. Either of these will work to access the address in the future and are intrinsically the same thing.
