Proof of work refers to the consensus method used to agree on what the next block is, who won it and what transations are to be included. 

This builds the foundation of the network, as each block is agreed upon by at least a majority of the nodes involved in teh network at any given time. The way this validation works is quite complex, if you would like to know more please see the [Advanced Consensus Documentation](#).
